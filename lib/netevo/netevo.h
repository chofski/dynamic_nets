 NetEvo is a computing framework designed to allow researchers to investigate 
 evolutionary aspects of dynamical complex networks. By providing tools to 
 easily integrate each of these factors in a coherent way, it is hoped a 
 greater understanding can be gained of key attributes and features displayed 
 by complex systems.
